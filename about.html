        <td>Listen! It's not about how good or bad he teach. It's üíØ% fact what I'm gonna share with you. I see, Many people teach out of circumstances,greed and passion but *Raghubir bhaiya*is the one who live,love and laugh with students. As a introvert child, I love to observe people.so, I'm wanna share with you some key points of him (what i observed till now üòå).
            1.The Aura he carry is tremendous,you will definitely feel once you come to his classroom.
            2.His 99 %presence of mind.
            3. He look after every students in a same manner, there is no partiality.
            4. I personally feel, when he start teaching;some magical vibes forming that you knowingly or unknowingly indulge in it and started love to study.
            4.The man who devoted his life for teaching.For him study is worship.

Even the weakest student can turn out to be the strongest in mathematics. I, myself was weak in maths but through "Bhaiya's" explanations, guidance and support i could work up on my potential and achieve excellent results!
